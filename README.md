# Zsh Evil Registers
Access external clipboards in `vicmd` or `viopp` keymaps.

If you have a supported clipboard program, simply use your familiar vim bindings:
- `"+` to specify the clipboard selection
- `"*` to specify the primary selection (the same as `"+` in some cases)

If you have a clipboard which is not supported, simply add it:
```zsh
ZSH_EVIL_COPY_HANDLERS[+]="program args"
ZSH_EVIL_PASTE_HANDLERS[+]="program args"
```

Then send us a pull request! We'd love to have wider support.

## Supported interfaces:

- xclip
- xsel
- wl-clipboard
- termux-clipboard

## Extensions:

If you have a clipboard (or any other function which you want to act as one),
you can register it by adding it to the associative arrays:

```zsh
ZSH_EVIL_COPY_HANDLERS[$key]="your-command"
ZSH_EVIL_PASTE_HANDLERS[$key]="your-command"
```

`your-command` will be `eval`d.
As an example, a simple one-directional append-to-text-file board can be implemented:

```zsh
ZSH_EVIL_COPY_HANDLERS[/]=">> $HOME/.scraps"
```
Now you can append to `~/.scraps` with `"/y<vi-motion>`.
